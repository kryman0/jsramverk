# Installation

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have npm and node (version ^14, could work on a lower version also) installed.

## Setup

Clone the repository with *git clone git@github.com:kryman0/jsramverk.git*. With the repo comes a pre-configured package.json file. To install the Vue JavaScript framework, and other components and necessary dependencies just run *npm install* in the root folder (where package.json is located).

Start the application by browsing the dist/index.html file.
