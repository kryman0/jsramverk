# Installation

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have npm and node (version ^14, could work on a lower version also) installed.

## Setup

Clone the repository with *git clone git@github.com:kryman0/jsramverk.git*. With the repo comes a pre-configured package.json file. To install the Vue JavaScript framework, and other components and necessary dependencies just run *npm install* in the root folder (where package.json is located).

Start the application by running *npm run start*. It will start in webpack-dev-server mode. For now the watch mode via *npm run watch* will not work.

## Trying out the application

1. Register a new user.
2. Login. (The link to the reports page will then be visible.)
3. Create a report on reports page.
4. After creating a report you can select any report to do some of the CRUD functions on them.
